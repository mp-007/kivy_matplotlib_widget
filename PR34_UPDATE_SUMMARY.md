# PR #34 Update Summary

## Problem
PR #34 (https://github.com/mp-007/kivy_matplotlib_widget/pull/34) was not mergeable into the `cleanup` branch because:
- The cleanup branch received additional changes from PR #32 (isort) and PR #33 (trailing whitespace removal)
- PR #34's source branch `copilot/format-src-files-to-pep8` was outdated and had merge conflicts

## Solution Applied
1. **Applied isort** to `copilot/format-src-files-to-pep8` with `--profile black` to match cleanup's import ordering
2. **Merged cleanup branch** into `copilot/format-src-files-to-pep8` to incorporate the latest changes
3. **Resolved conflicts** by keeping the PEP8-formatted versions (black, autopep8) which include better formatting than cleanup's changes
4. **Merged the updated format branch** into `copilot/cleanup-branch` (the working branch for this task)

## Current State
- `copilot/cleanup-branch` (pushed to remote) has all changes from PR #34 plus the updates to make it compatible with cleanup
- `copilot/format-src-files-to-pep8` (local only) also has these updates but hasn't been pushed to remote
- Both branches have identical content and can merge cleanly into cleanup

## Verification
- ✅ All Python files compile successfully
- ✅ Flake8 reports 188 violations (as expected per PR #34 description):
  - 153 E501 (line too long) - intentional for readability
  - 24 F841 (unused variables) - debugging placeholders  
  - 11 F401 (unused imports) - may be part of public API
